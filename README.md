consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API. The HAL browser (a webapp) is available at http://localhost:8080/api.
The HAL browser can be used use it to navigate the app and create new resources. For more information read the [HAL browser paragraph
from the spring data rest reference documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/2.4.2.RELEASE/reference/html/#_the_hal_browser).

# Spring Actuator
[Spring Boot Actuator](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-actuator) includes a number of additional 
features to help you monitor and manage your application when itâ€™s pushed to production. You can choose to manage and monitor your 
application using HTTP endpoints. Auditing, health and metrics gathering can be automatically applied to your application. 
The [user guide](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready) covers the features in more detail.
