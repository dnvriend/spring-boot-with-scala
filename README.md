# spring-boot-with-scala
A small study project on how to use [spring-boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), with [Akka](http://akka.io/). 

# TL;DR
[Spring](https://spring.io/) can create actor instances using the actor system. They can be used in the 
[CountingController](https://github.com/dnvriend/spring-boot-with-scala/blob/spring-boot-akka/src/main/scala/com/github/dnvriend/controller/CountingController.scala)
for handling REST calls and calling the Actor.

# Security
The web service is secured with Basic Authentication. The credentials are:

- username: foo
- password: bar

# The HAL browser
[Hypertext Application Language](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) or HAL is a simple format that gives a 
consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API. The HAL browser (a webapp) is available at http://localhost:8080/api.
The HAL browser can be used use it to navigate the app and create new resources. For more information read the [HAL browser paragraph
from the spring data rest reference documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/2.4.2.RELEASE/reference/html/#_the_hal_browser).

# Spring Actuator
[Spring Boot Actuator](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-actuator) includes a number of additional 
features to help you monitor and manage your application when itâ€™s pushed to production. You can choose to manage and monitor your 
application using HTTP endpoints. Auditing, health and metrics gathering can be automatically applied to your application. 
The [user guide](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready) covers the features in more detail.
